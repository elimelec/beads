Disable auto-flush by default (require explicit --enable-auto-flush)\n2. Add .beadsignore to exclude issue ID patterns\n3. Make auto-flush only export 'real' issues (exclude test-*)\n4.

Document that production DB is for real work only\n2. Add a convenience command: `bd test-create` that uses a separate test database\n3. Clean up the existing test pollution: bd-52 through bd-58\n4. Consider adding a git pre-commit hook to warn about suspicious issues\n\nThis preserves auto-flush (which is valuable) while preventing pollution at the source.","notes":"## Resolution\n\n**Root Cause Identified:**\nThe issue was NOT a bug in auto-flush, but rather test pollution in the production database from manual testing/debugging. Go tests are properly isolated using temp directories.\n\n**Actions Taken:**\n1. Cleaned up test pollution: deleted bd-52 through bd-58 (all \"Version test issue\" entries)\n2. Verified auto-flush is working correctly - it exports the database as designed\n3. Confirmed Go test isolation works properly (uses temp dirs, not production DB)\n\n**Prevention Strategy:**\n- Production database (.beads/) should only contain real work issues\n- Manual testing should use throwaway databases or test scripts\n- Go tests already use isolated temp databases\n- Auto-flush is working as intended and should remain enabled\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis was user error, not a system bug.

{"id":"bd-191","title":"Beads Library Integration","description":"Migrate from custom SQLite implementation to using Beads as a library dependency. This eliminates ~3000 lines of duplicated code, reduces schema drift risk, and automatically inherits new Beads features.\n\n**Key Benefits:**\n- Remove 3000+ lines of duplicated SQLite code\n- Eliminate schema drift between bd and vc CLIs\n- Inherit Beads improvements automatically\n- Stronger type safety with Beads error types\n- Faster development velocity for new features\n- Clean separation: Beads stays general-purpose, VC extends via wrapper\n\n**Architecture Principle:**\nBeads remains 100% standalone with NO VC dependencies. VC imports Beads (VC → Beads dependency) and wraps it with VC-specific storage methods. Both share the same database but maintain separate table namespaces.\n\n**Current Pain Points:**\n1. Code Duplication: Issue CRUD, dependency graphs, labels, status transitions all reimplemented\n2. Schema Drift Risk: VC schema manually defined, could diverge from Beads\n3. Lost Features: Can't leverage Beads query optimizer or advanced features without process spawning\n4. Atomic Operations: Hand-rolled 100+ line transaction management\n5. Maintenance Burden: Every Beads feature must be manually replicated\n\n**Concrete Example:**\nWhen Beads adds a new field (e.g., estimated_hours):\n- Current: 4-6 hours of manual work (update types, 6+ SQL queries, migration, testing)\n- With Library: 5 minutes (go get -u github.com/steveyegge/beads)\n\n**Phased Approach:**\n1. Phase 1: Add Beads dependency (non-breaking, feature flag)\n2. Phase 2: Implement VCStorage wrapper (embeds beads.Storage)\n3. Phase 3: Migration script for existing databases\n4. Phase 4: Gradual cutover, deprecate SQLite code\n\n**Related Analysis:**\nSee BEADS_INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md for detailed current state analysis and BEADS_LIBRARY_INTEGRATION_EPIC.md for full design document (both to be archived after issue creation).\n\n**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 sprints\n**Priority:** P2 (Medium-High - architectural improvement, high ROI)","notes":"Phase 1 (bd-59) complete!

Once populated, never resyncs.\n\nFix needed: \n1. Sync counter after import operations (not just empty table)\n2. Add counter resync after renumber\n3.

All operations (import, delete, renumber) now properly sync counters.
